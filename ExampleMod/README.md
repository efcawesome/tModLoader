# What is ExampleMod
This folder contains the source code for a mod called `ExampleMod`. It is intended to be used by modders to learn how to correctly make various types of content. Modders learning to make mods should frequently consult `ExampleMod` and look for examples similar to what they want to make. It is expected the new modders start exploring `ExampleMod` after completing the [Basic tModLoader Modding Guide](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/Basic-tModLoader-Modding-Guide).

# How to use ExampleMod

## View Online
You can view the files of `ExampleMod` here on GitHub by navigating through the folders listed above. A good place to start is weapons. Click the links to navigate to the "Content" folder, then "Items" folder, then "Weapons". From there, click on "ExampleGun.cs". You can now read the source code for the `ExampleGun` `ModItem` directly in your web browser. Feel free to explore other folders to find other examples.

### Search within ExampleMod
Click [here](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3AtModLoader%2FtModLoader%20path%3A%2F%5EExampleMod%5C%2F%2F%20&type=code) to open a search page that will search specifically within `ExampleMod`. After opening that page, click on the search bar at the top and type a search term, for example "chair", and then press enter. The page will update with results from `ExampleMod` containing your search term. Use this to quickly find files relevant to what you want to learn about.

### Note about upcoming code
By default, the code you see here contains changes from the next version of tModLoader. Sometimes these changes contain code that does not exist on the current version of tModLoader. You can switch to the `stable` branch to view `ExampleMod` code intended for the currently released version of tModLoader. To do this, find the dropdown in the top left of this webpage that says "1.4.4" and use it to select the "stable" option. 

## Download
It can be useful to download `ExampleMod` for easier reference. First, click [here](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/archive/refs/heads/stable.zip) to download `stable.zip`. Open it and then open the "ExampleMod" folder within. You can extract the "ExampleMod" folder to your "ModSources" folder. (The "ModSources" folder can be found within the [saves folder](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader/wiki/Basic-tModLoader-Usage-Guide#saves).) 

Once `ExampleMod` is in your "ModSources" folder, you can even build it in-game just like any other mod. This is useful if you want to experiment with `ExampleMod` directly.
